      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Onyebuchi Michael Ugwu</strong>, a Nigerian-born U.S.
        citizen. I was trafficked across borders and later framed as the
        “unstable relative” to erase valid claims. Recognition I
        earned—including a letter from President Obama—was made to vanish. A
        €600k Clyvia GmbH deal disappeared from negotiations. This platform
        resists erasure with documentation and tools.

      <h3>Letter of Undertaking — Legal Relevance</h3>
      <p className="small">
        A letter obtained under pressure can show <em>duress</em>,{" "}
        <em>coercion</em>, and <em>estate fraud</em>. When legal instruments are
        used to control movement, labor, or access to property, they can
        function as mechanisms of trafficking. Survivors deserve recognition
        when “family disputes” are actually exploitation.
